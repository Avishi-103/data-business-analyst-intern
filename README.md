Throughout my internship, I leveraged Python and Excel to conduct comprehensive customer data analysis, employing various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

The projects featured here highlight my contributions to improving business outcomes. For instance, I played a pivotal role in enhancing conversion rates by 10% through thorough analysis of customer funnels and user flows, utilizing statistical models and machine learning concepts such as decision trees. Additionally, I identified and recommended discontinuation of an unprofitable partner channel, resulting in an 8% reduction in bad loans.

As a member of the Risk Analysis team, I gained invaluable experience in applying my technical skills to real-world scenarios, where the decisions made had tangible impacts on the company's success. Through this repository, I aim to share the code files and insights gained from my internship projects, providing a glimpse into my analytical capabilities and contributions to business optimization.
